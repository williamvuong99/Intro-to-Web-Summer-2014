#Hello
+ My name is Niya. 
+ I am a Graphic Designer, who wants to learn about Web Design in order to get a more rounded eduation in Desing. 
+ I am excited about the classes and hope to freelance or join a design studio afterwards. 
+ I would love to be involved in the UX/UI design area of Web Design.
+ The actress who would play me would be Kristen Wiig, cause she is akward and comfortable in her akwardness.
