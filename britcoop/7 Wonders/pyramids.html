Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure.

Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.orghttp://en.wikipedia.orghttp://en.wikipedia.orghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry" title="Quarry">quarry</a> and dragging and lifting them into place.</p>
