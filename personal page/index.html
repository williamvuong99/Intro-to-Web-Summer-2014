		<p>I'm a Sales Ops Analyst at a predictive analytics software company. I support the sales team by providing training for salesforce.com and industry research. I am also responsible for month-end, quarter-end, and year-end sales analysis.</p>
		<p>"Everything in moderation" is how I live. With that being said, although you'd find me at the gym after work, it is also very likely I had an intense poutine for lunch.</p>
		<p class="red-paragraph">I would get Alison Brie to play me on the big screen. Arcade Fire as the soundtrack.</p>
