# Week 2 - Class 3 : CSS Positioning and Layouts

## In Class

We're going to dive deeper into CSS and learn about the positioning and layout of HTML elements. An understanding of CSS positioning will help us understand how HTML elements interact with each other and how we can position those elements to achieve the results we want.

**Some of the things we'll be doing:**

- The CSS Box Model and how it relates to 'padding', 'border', and 'margin'.
- Using 'static', 'fixed', 'relative', and 'absolute' positioning to adjust HTML elements on our pages.
- Discussing 'block' vs. 'inline' elements, how they appear on our pages, and how we can change an elements default 'display' property.
- Using all of the above positioning techniques to create and modify the layout of our HTML pages.
- Using Git and GitHub to share our code and push our projects to a remote repo.

## Learning Objectives

Students should understand the following:

### The Box Model

- What is the box model?
- What is the difference between 'padding', 'border', and 'margin'? How do these 3 things affect each element on our page?
- How do these 3 things affect the size (width/height) of an element on our page?

### Block vs. Inline

- What is the difference between 'block' and 'inline' elements?
- Which HTML tags are 'block' elements? Which are 'inline' elements?
- How do we override the CSS 'display' property of an element?

### Static, Fixed, Relative, And Absolute Positioning

- What is the difference between 'static', 'fixed', 'relative', and 'absolute' positioning?
- How do these different types of positioning change the layout or 'flow' of our documents?
- What are some examples of when you would use each of the above?

## Assignments

#### Create a simple website that includes the following:

- Position multiple elements using 'padding', 'margin', and 'border'.
- Use both 'block' and 'inline' elements on your site.
- Use 'static', 'fixed', 'relative', and 'absolute' positioning at least once on your site. 
- Use Git to track the changes to your site as you work.
- Push your creation to your GitHub profile.
- Be prepared to share your code in class and describe how positioning works.
