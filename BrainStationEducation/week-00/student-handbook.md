# Student Handbook : Introduction To Web Development

**We've created this handbook to provide you with more information about the course, but more importantly, to help you establish habits and processes that will make you a better student, and ultimately, a better developer.**

## Culture

At BrainStation, we believe that you are a product of your environment. Simply put, we want you to complete our programs ready to conquer the digital space. In order to do so we aim at creating a community and culture that embraces creativity and collaboration. In order to do so a few things need to be considered from all parties involved.

### Integrity

- We are our word, be honest
- Showing up on time and being present
- Owning it

### Accountability

- We are our actions
- Asking for help (Google, classmate, educator)
- Providing help to others
- Put in the time outside of class to be successful

### Support

- We are supportive of the skill levels, goals and aspirations of others
- We do everything in our power to help facilitate growth
- We give constant, constructive feedback
- Learning to learn

## Our Mission

An ecosystem that fosters innovation, that attracts the best companies and brightest minds, requires a supply of talented people with the right skills. We create those people. Our students leave BrainStation with the skills and confidence to shape a future they want for themselves. We empower them with the ability to solve meaningful problems with technology and to create on the canvas of the 21st century.

## Learning Strategies

### Approaches To Learning

At BrainStation you'll be introduced to a new learning environment and mindset. You will be confronted daily by your own limitations whether they be technical or cultural. Moreover, you will not be able to rely on grades to figure out how you are doing. You will have to assess yourself and determine whether you are progressing at a rate that satisfies you. Our instructors and facilitators are here to guide you, and to be used as a resource when you're stuck. However, it is your responsibility to direct your learning and let us know how we can help.

Although the focus of this course is technology and programming, we think it is very important that you learn how to learn. Understanding how to solve problems, how to answer your own questions, and being confident in your ability to tackle any challenge is equally, if not more important, than learning to code. When you leave here, you should have the skills to continue your learning and self-improvement on your own.

#### In Order To Be Successful At BrainStation Students Need To:

- Be comfortable not knowing everything
- Be resourceful and adaptive when solving problems
- Be willing to make mistakes
- Turn failures into learning opportunities
- Ask questions, even when they think they know
- Be excited to teach others
- Be patient and supportive with others
- Spend the time needed to complete all the work assigned

### Mastery Based Learning

This program is not about obtaining a certificate or diploma. We want you to leave here with real skills that allow you to create awesome technology. We've designed this program to be cumulative in the sense that each concept, class, or week builds on previous ones. Spend time diving deep into each topic and ensure that you truly understand before moving forward. If you don't feel comfortable with a topic, don't limit yourself to materials, resources, or the amount of time we provide. It's important that you move at a pace that is comfortable for you. We are going to cover a lot in the short time that you're with us so it is unrealistic to think that you'll be an expert by the end of the course. But if you approach learning with the intention of mastering each topic, you will go a long way. Furthermore, this is a technique and mindset can be applied to other areas of your life.

It is much better to have a deep understanding of a few things, than a superficial understanding of many things.

## Asking Questions, Troubleshooting, Debugging, and Google

At it's core, building software and being a software developer is about solving problems. A good software developer doesn't know the answer to every question or the solution to every problem. A good software developer understands how to find answers and solve problems given the information and resources available to them. By developing a process or procedure for solving problems, you will become much more effective as a student, and ultimately as a software developer.

#### When you get stuck or have a question, always follow this these steps in the order they appear:

1. **Google:** You can find the answer to anything on Google. It may take a few minutes of reading and sorting through search results, but be patient and persistent.

2. **Ask a classmate:** Often times the problem you're working on is something a classmate is also working on or something a classmate has found a solution for. It's important that all of you support each other. Communicate, collaborate and share with your classmates.

3. **Ask an instructor:** If you've tried Google and your classmates, and you're still stuck, ask an instructor. Your instructors are always happy to help, but it's important that you've tried to solve the problem on your own, with the resources available to you.

### Borrowing From Others

Because there are often full solutions to coding problems available online or through your classmates, it’s easy to borrow the code of others and implement it in your own projects without fully understanding what it does. While we encourage students to use all the resources available to them, it is important that you understand what you’ve created and how it works. 

## Feedback

The BrainStation classroom is a learning environment for both students and instructors. While you're learning to program and create awesome technology, we're learning how best to help you on your journey. There is always room to improve and we'd love to here your feedback if you think we can do something better. Ultimately, communicating a problem and a solution with us will help improve the learning experience for you, your classmates, and our team.

#### Feedback Should Always Be:

1. **Constructive:** It's important that the learning environment is a supportive, friendly, and fun place. When giving feedback, always ensure it's constructive and helps the individual(s) grow. 

2. **Action Oriented:** Always try and provide an action step with feedback. Once you've identified where improvement can be made, it's important to indicate how to implement that improvement. What can be done better and how can it be done better.
