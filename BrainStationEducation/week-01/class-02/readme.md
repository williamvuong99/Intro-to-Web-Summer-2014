# Week 1 - Class 2 : Basic HTML, CSS, And Multi-page Websites

## In Class

We'll be building a simple, multi-page website. In doing so, we will begin to familiarize ourselves with how we setup a new project (website), some basic html and css, and we'll use Git and GitHub to share our code.

**Some of the things we'll be doing:**

- Setup the files and folders for a basic website.
- Create our HTML and CSS files separately, and then connect them using the HTML 'link' tag.
- Connect all of our HTML pages together using the 'anchor' tag so that users can navigate to different pages on our sites.
- Insert images and other media into our sites.
- Learn more about the different HTML tags available to us and how we use them 'semantically'.
- Learn more about basic CSS styles and how they affect the layout and appearance of our websites.
- Learn about CSS Specificity.
- Use Git and GitHub to share our code.
- Push our newly create sites to GitHub.
